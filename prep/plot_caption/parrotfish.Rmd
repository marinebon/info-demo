Parrotfish are grazers that help prevent algae from overgrowing on coral reefs. The Florida Keys trophic group consists of X species from the family *Scaridae*. They are among the most common large fish seen on Caribbean coral reefs. The density, biomass, and diversity indices were computed from the multi-agency Reef Visual Census.
